  ## Description
  This is my week 11-Challenge. This is a simple application where the user will be able to add and delete simple notes for keeping track of tasks. In this challenge I was givin starter code that and I needed to create api routes for the application. I had to make sure that all the routes were synced properly so the html would diplay correctly after adding and deleting notes from the array of notes.
